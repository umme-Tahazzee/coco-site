                    <p>Many years later, Imelda's great-great-grandson, Miguel, now lives with the elderly Coco and
                        their family, including Miguel's parents and his grandmother, who are also shoemakers. Despite
                        his family's music ban, Miguel secretly idolizes the deceased musician Ernesto de la Cruz, and
                        teaches himself to play guitar by watching Ernesto's old films. On the Day of the Dead, Miguel
                        inadvertently bumps into the family ofrenda, breaking a frame containing a photo of Imelda and
                        an infant Coco. He discovers a hidden section of the photograph shows his
                        great-great-grandfather, whose head has been torn from the photo, holding Ernesto's famous
                        guitar. Believing this proves Ernesto is his relative, Miguel tells his family he will become a
                        musician.<br>
